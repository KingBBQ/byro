byro
----

byro is currently very very much work in progress. It will be a membership administration tool
for small and medium sized clubs/NGOs/associations of all kinds, with a focus on the DACH region.

We are planning to have a large amount of documentation, but at the moment we are still working on
it (and on byro itself), so it is incomplete and work-in-progress.

We're organizing our documentation in the following categories:

- **User documentation** which explains how to use a byro instance with your organization, what to
  expect, and which plugins to use.
- **Administrator documentation** for those who deploy, update, and maintain byro instances.
