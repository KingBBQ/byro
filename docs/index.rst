byro
----

byro is a membership administration tool currently in use at shackspace. It is meant
for small and medium sized clubs/NGOs/associations of all kinds, with a focus on the DACH region.
byro is heavily plugin based to help fit it to different requirements in many situations and
countries.

We are planning to have a large amount of documentation, but at the moment we are still working on
it (and on byro itself), so it's incomplete and work-in-progress.

We're organizing our documentation in the following categories:

- **Developer documentation** for those helping develop byro features and plugins.
- **[TODO] Administrator documentation** for those who deploy, update, and maintain byro instances.
- **[TODO] User documentation** which explains how to use a byro instance with your organization, what to
  expect, and which plugins to use.
